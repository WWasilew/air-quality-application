Air Quality Application is a Python-based tool that provides real-time air quality data for locations in Poland. The application fetches data from the official [GIOŚ API](https://powietrze.gios.gov.pl/) and visualizes the results in an easy-to-understand chart. 
Stay informed about air quality and make healthier decisions! ✨

## Features

- **Real-Time Data:** Displays up-to-date air quality information.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Plots air quality data on dynamic charts.
- **API Integration:** Connects to the GIOŚ API for reliable air quality data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for seamless use.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Tools:**
  - `requests` (API calls)
  - `matplotlib` (chart visualization)
